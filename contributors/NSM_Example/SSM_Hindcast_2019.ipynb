    "## Prediction Simulation for Water Year 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be testing and evaluating the performance of the model over the 2019 WY at select locations\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the operational capacity of the model should begin at the beginning of the water year (WY week 1) with a previous SWE value of 0-in for each 1-km grid.\n",
    "Model evaluation could then assess the forecasting skill on a hold-out dataset of an entire year in which known neighboring values do not control predictions, but rather driving to-date predictions from the predicted previous SWE values. \n",
    "Due to the high model performance, future work will target the assessment of model skill with an operational motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training/Testing influence on Model Results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model training/testing partitioning methodology has a strong influence on model performance and the goal of model evaluation.\n",
    "The objective of the modeling effort was to examine the spatial extrapolation capacity of the model from selected monitoring stations to the overall region, best suited to a 75/25% training/testing split, respectively.\n",
    "While it is critical to address the strong serial correlation in SWE accumulation and melt throughout the season, the high correlation between weeks has the potential to inflate model skill when using a 75/25% training/testing split due to the previous SWE feature being known.\n",
    "An assessment of the operational capacity of the model is different than assessing the ability to extrapolate regional SWE from in-situ monitoring stations.\n",
    "For example, the operational capacity of the model should begin at the beginning of the water year (WY week 1) with a previous SWE value of 0-in for each 1-km grid.\n",
    "Model evaluation could then assess the forecasting skill on a hold-out dataset of an entire year in which known neighboring values do not control predictions, but rather driving to-date predictions from the predicted previous SWE values. \n",
